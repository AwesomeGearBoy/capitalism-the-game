# CHANGELOG ver0.0.0 - ver0.3.0:
 - Building the fundamentals of the game (building layout, collecting revanue, upgrading levels, and buying warehouses)

# CHANGELOG ver.0.4.0:
 - Added save data to the game, and allowed for game saving.
 - Added random events that happen periodically as you collect revanue.
 - Added `README.md`.
 - Added `CHANGELOG.md`.
 - First pre-release, although still a beta version.

# CHANGELOG ver.0.4.1:
 - Added `DELETEME.md` to `save` folder so that GitHub does not get rid of the saving features.

# CHANGELOG ver.0.5.0:
 - Made bug fixes.
 - Added credits.
 - Fixed grammer, spelling, and capitalization throughout the game because I can't English.
 - Created a loading screen to give variables and assets time to load fully.
 - Made RosesRed event get rid of all of your money.
 - Basic preparation for a full release.

# CHANGELOG ver.0.5.1:
 - More bug fixes
 - More grammer fixes
 - Actually exported the new updates! Sorry for the holdup, I did not know that I had to edit the `capitalism-game.exe` file after each update.
 - Planned to be last pre-release before full release.

# CHANGELOG ver.1.0.0:
 - Changed how game saving works; old game files will now be incompatable with full release and going forward. Pre-release save files are only compatable with other pre-release save files.
 - Removed `icon.svg` from project (finally).
 - Simplified changing game version (for myself).
 - Finished on a little gift box as a gift for downloading the full release of the game. This should start to pave the way for future events and future gifts.
 - Did major bugtesting. `String` variables are incompatable with the `SaveData` class. I cannot save `String` variables, but I can load them. Everything else there works.
 - Editted `KeyControl` class. I am now able to make it so that if anything is pressed, it will return `true`.
 - First full release of the game! Here's to more in the future!

# CHANGELOG ver.1.1.0:

# CHANGELOG ver.1.1.1:

# CHANGELOG ver.1.1.2:

 - Increased game's framerate from 120 FPS to 300 FPS. This will increase the use for auto mode, as auto mode increases the money you have once per frame.

# CHANGELOG ver.1.2.0:
 - Balanced out game, making certain things obtainable through level up.
 - Changed salvaging mechanics; should give more money now.
 - `savedata.gd` is updated to maximize efficiency, allowing for loading of data type `String` and also maximizes efficiency of loading `boolean` data types.
 - Added S.T.O.C.K program, for all of your stock market needs (unlocked at level 30)!

# CHANGELOG ver.1.2.1:
 - Fixed bug where auto mode still runs while S.T.O.C.K is running.
 - Actually allowed secret to happen in S.T.O.C.K System...
